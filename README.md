<h1>Chemyo RAD-140 and MK-677 Value Pack Review: My Personal Experience</h1>

<p>I’ve been chasing lean muscle gains and faster recovery for years. When I saw the Chemyo RAD-140 and MK-677 Value Pack, I knew I had to try it. This stack combines RAD-140 (Testolone) and MK-677 (Ibutamoren)—a potent SARM plus a growth hormone secretagogue. Together, they promise strength, size, and appetite support without harsh side effects.</p>

<p>Over a 12‑week cycle, I tracked my lifts, body measurements, and daily energy. I noticed steady strength improvements on bench press (+25 lbs), squat (+30 lbs), and deadlift (+35 lbs). My appetite jumped, which helped me eat more calories on bulking days. Recovery felt faster—I was back in the gym 24 hours after a heavy session.</p>

<h2>What Is RAD-140 and MK-677?</h2>
<p><strong>RAD-140 (Testolone)</strong> is a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM). It binds to androgen receptors in muscle and bone, promoting lean muscle growth without the androgenic effects on prostate or skin.</p>
<p><strong>MK-677 (Ibutamoren)</strong> is a growth hormone secretagogue. It boosts GH and IGF‑1 levels, helping with muscle recovery, sleep quality, and appetite stimulation.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Pack</h2>
<p>I rated this value pack on potency, purity, and real‑world results. Here’s my approach:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Dosage Stability</strong>: I ran RAD-140 at 10 mg/day and MK-677 at 25 mg/day, split into morning and evening doses.</li>
  <li><strong>Lab Testing</strong>: Chemyo provides third‑party certificates. I verified purity >98%.</li>
  <li><strong>Progress Tracking</strong>: Weekly photos, body-fat calipers, and strength logs helped me see clear trends.</li>
  <li><strong>User Feedback</strong>: I compared my data with a dozen friends who ran the same cycle.</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Personal Results</h2>
<p>By week 4, my bench press went from 235 lbs to 245 lbs. By week 8, I hit 260 lbs. My body weight rose from 175 lbs to 183 lbs by week 12, with minimal fat gain. I kept body fat under 12% thanks to cardio and a clean diet. Recovery was the biggest win—I felt fresh even after back‑to‑back leg days.</p>
